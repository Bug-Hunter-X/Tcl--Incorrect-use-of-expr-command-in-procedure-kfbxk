This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon error in Tcl programming related to the improper use of the `expr` command within a procedure. The `bug.tcl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.  The error highlights a subtle syntax issue that can lead to unpredictable results and is not immediately obvious to less experienced Tcl developers.
